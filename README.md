# ArduinoFM
Make a DIY FM Radio with an Arduino, a small LCD and a TEA5767 module!

Please note that all project details and comments are in catalan, due to school requirements,
but you can ask me at any time for specific translations!

You can see more details about this at https://tiny.cc/tdrericroy

### What is it?
In this repository you will find the necessary information to make your own FM radio, and even to improve this old 2018 design.
In the webpage you will find some pictures about that project, so make sure to check that, and get some inspiration!

### What do I have to do?
There are 4 steps to do:
* Make sure you have all the material: Arduino, TEA5767 module, speakers and some leds/wires/buttons, ...
* Build the circuits, you can make your own design.
* Run your code (with the TEA5767 library) on the Arduino IDE, and upload it to the board.
* Have fun listening RockFM!

### More info
This project has been made in 2018 by myself (Eric Roy) for school and learn purposes. It hasn't got the best code, but remember that at that age i was only fifteen!!
